# Byrdle - with apologies to Wordle

This is the code repository for the *old* version of Byrdle. We are in the process of moving to a new site.

If you're looking to play the game, you should go to https://www.byrdle.net. If you've played Byrdle on the old website, then on your first visit to the new site, simply press the button to start importing your statistics.

Byrdle is a choral-music-themed word guessing game, similar in style to Wordle.
